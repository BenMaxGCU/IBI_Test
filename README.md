<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hi,

Thanks for looking at my technical test, I gave it my best attempt within the time and enjoyed building a project to demonstrate my skills.

I didn't get the chance to test the api in depth, I believe there are some issues with authorization but I think all the endpoints are working and returning expected result without authorization.

The endpoints are:

* /services
* /service/id
* /users
* /regions
* /organisations
* /contracts
* /contractgroups

If there is any issue contact me.

### Built With

* [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
